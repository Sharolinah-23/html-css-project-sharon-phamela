                <h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi, My name is Sharon!</p>
                <p>I am a passionate up coming Software Developer and a dynamic Project Y member who is currently in a Re:coded bootcamp to become the best software developer both locally, in South Africa and internationally.</p>
                <p>My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and AI.</p>
                <p>I aim to incorporate my technical skills with health and cosmetics. My goal is to introduce AI tools in the hair industry and collaborate with Tricologists, Cosmetologists and Demartologists to improve and elevate hair diagnostics and give customers a personal and tailored solution to their unique hair problems.</p>
                <p>I am driven by my love for coding, but most importantly using my coding skills in my innovations to solve complex problems alongside AI tools.</p>
                <p>Outside of work I am a mentor, singer, song writter, home chef and a hair consultant for african hair.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Gauteng Province, South Africa. I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Human Physiology at the University of Pretoria, where I immersed myself in various enriching programs.</p>
                <p>During my time at university, I participated in a unique program that trained individuals to become hair panelists, focusing on testing hair products on natural and relaxed African hair. This program emphasized understanding the specific needs and characteristics of African hair, providing valuable insights into hair care and product effectiveness.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, I joined the Girls for Girls University of Pretoria cohort, a mentorship program dedicated to empowering young women in leadership roles within societies, communities, and professional environments. The program covered essential skills such as negotiation, effective communication, running for office, personal branding, problem-solving, etiquette, and the importance of supporting and uplifting other women.</p>
                <p>I completed my studies at the University of Pretoria in December 2023 and embarked on a new journey in 2024 by joining Project Y. As a member of the Cape Town cohort based in Innovation City, I am training to become a software developer through Re:coded classes and other platforms provided by the organization. This training not only focuses on technical skills but also on enhancing my soft skills, business communication, networking, and personal brand building. I also collaborate on projects with a company called The Delta at Innovation City, gaining practical experience in a dynamic environment.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!</p>
